A channel in Go is a typed conduit through which you can send and receive values with the channel operator <-. 
Channels provide a way for goroutines to communicate and synchronize their execution.

Channels are declared using the make function with the chan keyword.
ch := make(chan int)


The <- operator is used for sending and receiving values on a channel.

ch <- 42 // Send 42 to the channel
value := <-ch // Receive a value from the channel and assign it to 'value'
